<h4>Weather in Bahamas</h4>

     <div class="para1">
        Bahamian temperatures vary little throughout the year, averaging in the mid- to upper-20s Celsius in summer and winter, though summer does bring higher humidity making it feel much hotter, as well as a greater chance of rain which lasts through fall. September and October present the highest risk for hurricane activity, with the islands of Grand Bahama, Abaco and Andros most likely to be affected, although it’s still a rather rare occurrence.

        <div class="para2">
            <h4>Language</h4>

            <p>English is the official language spoken in the Bahamas. You will notice the dialect and slang can be rather difficult to understand, more so on the Out Islands.

            </p>

            <h4>Swim with dolphins on Blue Lagoon Island</h4>
            <p> Once a hideaway for pirate buccaneers and later a diver training ground during the Second World War, Blue Lagoon Island (officially known as Salt Cay) has established itself as one of the top all-round family attractions in The Bahamas.

                Draws include the gorgeous stretches of white sand that line the shores, the stony McCutcheon’s Tower that offers sweeping views of the Caribbean Sea, seemingly endless Segway tracks and walking paths through the coastal coconut palm groves, and an inland lagoon that’s packed with wildlife and watersports opportunities.
                
                Oh, and this is also the home of the acclaimed Dolphin Encounters program, affording travelers a chance to check off a line from the bucket list and swim with the ocean’s most intelligent mammals!</p>
